# Canola-Fertilizer-Plan

## Overview

The Canola-Fertilizer-Plan is a web-based application designed to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in calculating the precise amounts of nutrients required for optimal canola crop production. Utilizing historical yield data, yield goals, and soil organic matter percentages, this tool computes nutrient removal rates, nutrient uptake requirements, and the resulting fertilizer needs tailored to achieve specific yield objectives.

## Features

- **Nutrient Removal Calculation:** Determines the amount of nutrients removed from the soil based on the previous year's canola yield.
- **Nutrient Uptake Estimation:** Calculates the required nutrient uptake to meet the current year's yield goal.
- **Soil Organic Matter Contribution:** Integrates soil organic matter's contribution to available nitrogen, enhancing the accuracy of fertilizer recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple, intuitive interface for entering yield data, yield goals, and soil parameters to generate customized nutrient and fertilizer recommendations.

## Installation

This project does not require installation as it is a web-based application. To use the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. **Enter Last Year's Yield:** Input the previous year's yield in pounds per acre to calculate the nutrient removal.
2. **Set Your Yield Goal:** Specify your yield goal for the current year in pounds per acre.
3. **Input Soil Organic Matter Percentage:** If known, enter the percentage of soil organic matter to refine nitrogen recommendations.
4. **Calculate Fertilizer Requirements:** Click the "Calculate" button to generate a report of nutrient removal, nutrient uptake, and required fertilizer amounts.

## Development

This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will be built in Angular.js later on in the development stages.
